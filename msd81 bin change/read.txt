In order to use MHD to write the modified program section back to the ECU the CRC checksum at 0x80304 must be corrected.


1. Make the required modifications to the bin file.

2. Rename to "input.bin" and place in the same folder as "csprogram-windows.exe"

3. Run "csprogram-windows.exe" from CMD/PS. Map and Program checksums will be corrected automatically.
