Read/Write as MC9S12XD256 (XPROG 5.51) - chip is unsecured.

Chip model is MC9S12XDG128MAA - 2M42E

The module must be powered by car or 12v pins. Programmers are too weak.
(Pins 2,3 +12), (Pin 1 GND).

To decouple SVT from 0x326 (when fitted with EDC), SVT must be made to ignore 0x326 and instead listen to an arbitrary CANID that we control.
To find the CANID in the SVT module binary shift CANID to the left 5 times. 
I.e 0x326 << 5 = 64 C0. 64 C0 is stored at 0xD8C2D.
To change to 0x327 set 0xD8C2D/E to 64 E0.

Remove error 6571:
Set D88AF/B0 to 00.
